# PasswordManager
Simple implementation of a password manager in Python
To enhance the security of the password manager, we can use encryption to store and retrieve passwords. In this example, we'll use the cryptography library to perform encryption and decryption. Please make sure to install the library by running pip install cryptography before using the enhanced code.

**Introduction:**
This is a simple command-line password manager written in Python.
**Features:**
Add new passwords for websites.
Retrieve passwords for websites.
Update passwords for existing websites.
Usage:

Create an instance of the PasswordManager class.
Use add_password() to add a new password.
Use get_password() to retrieve a password.
Use update_password() to update an existing password.
Security Considerations:

The passwords are stored in a JSON file, which is not secure for production use.
For a more secure implementation, consider using encryption and secure storage mechanisms.
Dependencies:

This code uses the json module for storing and loading passwords.
The getpass module is used to securely input passwords from the user.
Example Usage:

See the if __name__ == "__main__": block for an example of how to use the password manager.

**Enhancements:**

1. Encryption: The cryptography library is used for encryption and decryption.
The encryption key is stored in a separate file (key.key), which should be kept secure.

2. Security Considerations: The use of encryption helps protect sensitive information.
Ensure that you handle the encryption key securely.

3. Dependencies: This code uses the cryptography library for encryption.
Make sure to install the library by running pip install cryptography.

4. Key Management: The encryption key is generated if not found, and it is stored in the key.key file.
Keep the key file secure and do not share it.
